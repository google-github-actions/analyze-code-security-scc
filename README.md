# analyze-code-security-scc

## Description

This Github Action scans Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files for security risks. When a scan finds violations, this action will write the report in SARIF format to the workspace.
Currently only terraform plan files are supported for scanning.

## Prerequisites

-   This action requires a service account which have **Security Posture
    Shift-Left Validator or Security Posture Admin** Role on the Google Cloud
    organization to which IaC resources belong's. See
    [Authorization](#authorization) for more information.

-   This action runs using Node 20. If you are using self-hosted GitHub Actions
    runners, you must use a [runner
    version](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments) that supports this
    version or newer.

## Usage

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    permissions:
      contents: 'read'
      id-token: 'write'

    steps:
    - id: 'auth'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v2'
      with:
        workload_identity_provider: 'projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/providers/my-provider'
        service_account: 'my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com'

    - id: 'analyze-code-security-scc'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/analyze-code-security-scc@v1'
      with:
        organization_id: '123456789'
        scan_file_ref: './tf_plan.json'
        iac_type: 'terraform'
        iac_version: '1.0.0'
        scan_timeout: '1m'
        ignore_violations: false
        failure_criteria: 'High:1,Medium:1,Low:1,Operator:or'
        fail_silently: true

    - if: ${{ steps.analyze-code-security-scc.outputs.iac_scan_result_sarif_path != '' }}
        uses: 'actions/upload-artifact@v4'
        with:
          name: 'sarif'
          path: '${{ steps.analyze-code-security-scc.outputs.iac_scan_result_sarif_path }}'
```

## Inputs

-   `organization_id`: (Required) ID of the Google Cloud organization which owns
    resources under modification.

-   `scan_file_ref`: (Required) Absolute file path including file name where the
    IaC file is stored in the workspace. Examples: 'tf_plan.json',
    'artifacts/tf_plan.json'.

-   `iac_type`: (Required) IaC template type. Currently only Terraform is
    supported.

-   `iac_version`: (Required) IaC template version. Examples: '1.6.6', '1.6.5'.

-   `scan_timeout`: (Optional) Max time upto which action should run, should be
    between '1m' and '10m'. Default: 1m.

-   `ignore_violations`: (Optional) If set to true, violations found in IaC file
    will be ignored to determine build status. Although violations will not be
    ignored to generate SARIF report and determining iac_scan_result. Default:
    false.

-   `failure_criteria`: (Optional) Failure criteria evaluates workflow build
    status. It contains threshold for count of critical, high, medium, and low
    severity issues and `AND/OR` based aggregator to evaluate the criteria. The
    threshold for each severity is evaluated against count of issues with
    similar severity in IaC scan result and then severity level evaluations are
    aggregated using `AND\OR` to arrive at failure_criteria value.

    If `failure_criteria` evaluates to true, workflow is marked as `FAILED` otherwise workflow is marked as `SUCCESS`. Default: "Critical:1, High:1, Medium:1, Low:1, Operator:or".

-   `fail_silently`: (Optional) If set to true, workflow will not fail in case
    of any internal error including invalid credentials and plugin dependency
    failure. Note: Action will always fail in case of any input validation
    failure. Default: false.

## Outputs

-   `iac_scan_result`: Security Scan Result. One of:

    1.  `passed` - no violations found or the `failure_criteria` was not
        satisfied.
    2.  `failed` - `failure_criteria` was satisfied.
    3.  `error` - Action ran into execution error, generally due to
        misconfiguration or invalid credentials.

-   `iac_scan_result_sarif_path`: Path for the SARIF Report file. This is only
    available when violations are found in the scan file.
