  Scan IaC files for security risks.

inputs:
  organization_id:
    description: |-
      Google Cloud OrganizationId which owns resources under modification.
    required: true
  scan_file_ref:
    description: |-
      Absolute file path including file name where the IaC file is stored in the workspace.
      Ex: 'tf_plan.json', 'artifacts/tf_plan.json'.
    required: true
  iac_type:
    description: |-
      IaC template type. Currently only terraform is supported.
    required: true
  iac_version:
    description: |-
      IaC template version. Examples: '1.6.6', '1.6.5'.
    required: true
  scan_timeout:
    description: |-
      Max time upto which action should run, should be between '1m' and '10m'.
    default: '1m'
    required: false
  ignore_violations:
    description: |-
      If set to true, violations found in IaC file will be ignored to determine build status.
      Although violations will not be ignored to generate SARIF report and determining
      iac_scan_result.
    default: false
    required: false
  failure_criteria:
    description: |-
      Failure criteria evaluates workflow build status. It contains threshold for count of
      critical, high, medium, and low severity issues and AND/OR based aggregator to evaluate
      the criteria. The threshold for each severity is evaluated against count of issues with
      similar severity in IaC scan result and then severity level evaluations are aggregated using
      AND\OR to arrive at failure_criteria value.
      If failure_criteria evaluates to true, workflow is marked as FAILED otherwise workflow is marked as SUCCESS.
    default: 'Critical:1, High:1, Medium:1, Low:1, Operator:or'
    required: false
  fail_silently:
    description: |-
      If set to true, workflow will not fail in case of any internal error including invalid credentials
      and plugin dependency failure.
      Note: Action will always fail in case of any input validation failure.
    default: false
    required: false

outputs:
  iac_scan_result:
    description: |-
      Security Scan Result. One of:
      `passed` - no violations found or failure_criteria was not satisfied.
      `failed` - failure_criteria was satisfied.
      `error` - Action ran into execution error, generally due to misconfiguration or invalid credentials.
  iac_scan_result_sarif_path:
    description: |-
      Path for the SARIF Report file. This is only available when violations are found in the scan file.

runs:
  using: 'node20'
  main: 'dist/main/index.js'
