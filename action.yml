  Scan and analyze code for security risks using Google Cloud.

inputs:
  organization_id:
    description: |-
      The Google Cloud organization ID for the organization which includes 
      the resources that you want to modify.
    required: true
  scan_file_ref:
    description: |-
      The absolute file path, including the file name, for the IaC file in the 
      workspace. For example: './tf_plan.json', or './artifacts/tf_plan.json'.
    required: true
  iac_type:
    description: |-
      The IaC template type. Currently only Terraform is supported.
    required: true
  scan_timeout:
    description: |-
      The maximum time before the action stops. The time must be between '1m' and '10m'. 
    default: '1m'
    required: false
  ignore_violations:
    description: |-
      Whether violations found in IaC file should be ignored when determining 
      the build status. This input doesnâ€™t apply to  violations that are 
      related to generating SARIF reports and determining the `iac_scan_result`. 
    default: false
    required: false
  failure_criteria:
    description: |-
      The failure criteria that determines the workflow build status. You can set 
      a threshold for the number of critical, high, medium, and low severity 
      issues and use an aggregator  (either `and` or `or`) to evaluate the criteria. 
      To determine whether a build has failed, the threshold for each severity is 
      evaluated against the count of issues with that severity in the IaC scan 
      results and then severity level evaluations are aggregated using `AND` or `OR` 
      to arrive at `failure_criteria` value.
      If the `failure_criteria` evaluates to `true`, the workflow is marked as `FAILED`. 
      Otherwise, the workflow is marked as `SUCCESS`.
    default: 'Critical:1, High:1, Medium:1, Low:1, Operator:OR'
    required: false
  fail_silently:
    description: |-
      If set to true, workflow will not fail in case of any internal error including 
      invalid credentials and plugin dependency failure. 
      Note: Action will always fail in case of any input validationfailure.
    default: false
    required: false

outputs:
  iac_scan_result:
    description: |-
      The result of the security scan. One of:
      `passed` - No violations were found or the `failure_criteria` was not satisfied.
      `failed` - The `failure_criteria` was satisfied.
      `error` - The action ran into an execution error, generally due to a misconfiguration or invalid credentials.
  iac_scan_result_sarif_path:
    description: |-
      The path for the SARIF report file. This file is only available when violations are found in the scan file.
